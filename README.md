Todo App is a simple application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Users can add new todos, delete existing ones, and toggle the completion status of todos. Additionally, users can assign priorities to todos while creating them.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Fast, opinionated web dev build tool
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/): Simple, modular and accessible component library
- [Chakra Icons](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/media-and-icons/icon): Icon library for Chakra UI
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): A production-ready motion library for React
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server): Mock REST API server for rapid prototyping
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Typed superset of JavaScript

## Features

- Add new todos
- Delete existing todos
- Toggle completion status of todos
- Assign priorities to todos (Low, Medium, High)

## Project Outcomes

- Effective Use of TypeScript: Learned to effectively use TypeScript for type-checking and defining types for component props, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

- Custom Chakra UI Components: Explored Chakra UI and created custom UI components to enhance the functionality of the application.

- State Management with Async Operations: Managed and updated application state asynchronously, handling asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server and updating the UI accordingly.

- REST API Interaction: Interacted with a REST API using fetch to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todo items.
